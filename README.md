# baba-players
A simple, but useful, Web application that demonstrates how to implement an MVP architecture using **only vanilla Javascript** (no frameworks used!). 

## Motivation

In today's world, front-end web development is mainly conducted by Javascript-based frameworks (*i.e.* Angular, React, Vue.js, etc), which overwelm developers due to the many options available out there and their respectivetly peculiarities. The problem: they change pretty fast! So, how can your next web app be protected against those changes and be more easily mantainable? The answer is pretty simple: just apply software engineer principles! More precisely, know how to structure your app appling simple, but solid, software architecture concepts. 

## Description

This repository demonstrates how to develop a Single Page Application with an MVP architecture only using vanilla Javascript (that's it, only pure JS, without any framework!). The SPA only emulates the sing up page of a social network that connects people interested in playing soccer matches (a.k.a "baba" in some Brazilian states). The idea of this app is to be simple and have a really limited scope, so its architecture can be higlighted.
